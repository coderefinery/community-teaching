Community teaching training
===========================

.. admonition:: Under development (early 2022)

   As of Spring 2022, this is the new version of our previous
   `Instructor training
   <https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/>`__ and is
   still under development - there is an outline but content is not
   there yet.

In 2020, we got farther from our offices but closer to each other.  If
you could adapt to the circumstances, a huge number of possibilities
were opened - in particular with collaborative teaching.  In this
training, you will learn how to use them.  Teaching from 2019 is
almost obsolete - join us to learn more.

Teaching is a profession, but also something that everyone needs to be
able to do to some degree, since everyone has their own personal
specialties they will either teach or mentor.

Broadly, this covers:

- **Tools of teaching**: how to make the most out of online (and
  other) teaching
- **Workshop organization, collaboratively**: our vision of teaching
  together outside of our silos.
- **Socio-technical factors**: social and technical barriers to
  learning, why you need to care, and what you can do about them.
- **Lesson development, collaboratively**: how to design lessons and
  teaching materials so that they can be open and shared.

.. prereq::

   This course has no strict prerequisites, but

   * It is helpful if you have attended CodeRefinery or Carpentries
     workshops, which teach in an interactive and hands-on way.

   * We assume you already have competence in the technical tools you
     want to teach.  Many of our concepts use examples from
     CodeRefinery lessons, such as version control or other software
     development tools.

   * While not a prerequisite for this course, version control (git)
     is necessary to contribute to lessons development the way we show
     here (but the lesson design concepts are applicable to other
     styles, too).

.. _learner-personas:

Who is the course for?
----------------------

You run a practical teaching program at your institution (for example
as part of a research computing group) and would like to learn best
practices for collaborative teaching, so that you aren't re-inventing
the same thing over and over again.

You are a technical specialist who is frustrated with the way you
currently try to teach others who need to use your software or
infrastructure.  You can't spend too much time to become a
professional, but you know you need something more than what you've
been doing.  Thus, you would like to adopt some of the best practices of
designing and teaching interactive, hands-on workshops.

You've been teaching alone, but would like to join a collaboration
network for more co-teaching and to reduce the amount of duplication
of effort.

You are interested in teaching CodeRefinery lessons, and would like a
comprehensive kickstart to how CodeRefinery works either to join us,
or teach its lessons with us or independently.
